**Bigger outlets or competitions:**   The biggest risk is from the competition, such as food basics and walmart. Which are bigger companies and been there longer. They won't hesitate to reduce their rates a little just to put new business out of the market whereas we cannot compete with them unless we have better marketing strategies and more investment in backup. 

**Containment:**


**Slip and Fall Lawsuit:**  There are a lot of risk of slip and fall accidents, because of the weather. In Sault Ste. Marie, more than 6 months its snow and then two months rainy. So mostly we must be precaution of wet floor and other measures such as signs and put cleaning department always in store.

**Theft:**  It is most common risk in any business, theft of the physical items. We need to put a better security system.
 
**Inventory Damage:**  Due to the technology error or corrupt of data our inventory can be lost and it will result in buying products late and customer unsatisfaction.
 
**Forced Closure:**  This risk is always there. My business is depending on customers, due to vandalism or fire or natural disaster such as corona virus outbreak, I might be forced to close my business for a period, which will cause me not only monetary problems but the item I have in store will also expire which cost me more loss. For that I might take some insurance plan.
