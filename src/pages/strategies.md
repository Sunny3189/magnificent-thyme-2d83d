**Some areas to market our business.**

1. Facebook ads: As most of our app works on location base so we can use facebook ads which will help us to reach most customers. According to a survey there are very few people who donâ€™t use Facebook. So I think majority of our customers will be covered. As per my research the facebook ads cost is cost-per-click or CPM. It depends on what kind of way we choose. For CPC it will cost me approx $ 0.97 for every click whereas it cost around $ 7.19 per 1000 impressions. The cost can be flexible on some factors such as ad placement, market.

2. Google Ads: almost everyone today use internet and google one way or another. The cost for google ads is $ 1 or $2 per click. So according to this I think $10,000 will be good enough for the google ads.

3. Flyers: this is one of best way to reach local customers. To print 5000 pcs of 1 side, gloss flyers it will cost 190$ if the designing is also from the company we can add 120$ extra. So I think 10000 pcs will be enough to so it will cost us $310 for flyers.

4. Hoarding Boards: the most attractive way is to advertise the business in the big hoarding boards all over the city. One Small Poster cost $300 to $800 whereas bigger posters costs $1000 to $5000 depends on size. So if we 10 small posters and 5 big posters on favorite locations.

a. Small poster : $800 X 10 = $8000

b. Big posters: $4000 x 5 = $20000

c. Google Ads: $ 10000

d. Facebook ads: $ 10000

e. Flyers: 310$

f. Total = around $ 50,000
